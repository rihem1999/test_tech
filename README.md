# Test Tech

## Part One: Frontend

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4. To run the code, simply execute:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

## Part Two: Mobile Frontend

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the mobile frontend directory:
    ```sh
    cd frontendMobile
    ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4. To start the mobile application, execute:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
5. You can scan the QR code using the Expo Go app downloaded on your phone to test the app.

**Note:** There are no tests implemented for both frontend applications yet.

## Part Three: Backend API

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4. To start the backend server, execute:
    ```sh
    npm run start
    ```
5. To run the tests, execute:
    ```sh
    npm test
    ```

All tests work correctly, and a database has already been added. I have used Postman to test the API.
